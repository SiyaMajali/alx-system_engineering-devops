Hello World : A script that prints Hello, World, followed by a new line to the standard output.

Confused smiley : A script that displays a confused smiley: "(Ã”o)'.

Let's display a file : A script that displays the content of the /etc/passwd file.

What about 2? : A scipt that displays content of /etc/passwd and /etc/hosts.

Last lines of a file : A script that displays the last 10 lines of /etc/passwd.

I'd prefer the first ones actually : A scipt that displays the first 10 lines of etc/passwd.

Line #2 : A script that displays the third line of the file iacta. 
The file iacta will be in the working directory and you are not allowed to use sed.
